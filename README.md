Our main page shows the dashboard (with a link to direct you there more quickly), along with a link to take the survey. We also have a section for alternative activities to social media.

We have a navbar at the top which allows you to find links to the following: Dashboard, Survey, Database, More, and Login/Logout (depending on whether or not you're logged in).

When you are logged in you have access to the database, a "Create Account" option (located in the navbar for the Main Admin), along with an option to modify your account (when you click on the profile image in the top right of the navbar).

When you click on the "Survey" tab, you click on the "Take Survey" button which takes you to the survey. The survey consists of 3 chunks, with a "Next" button leading you to the next chunk (with a back option in case you want to change an answer).
All fields are required. If you try submitting the survey without entering an answer (like age, gender, etc), then you will be walked through each question you didn't answer.

When you click on the "Database" tab you will be directed to a page to select the view you want. After you make your selection, if you are not logged in, you get an alert telling you that login is required, and subsequently a redirect to the login page.
After you login, or if you're already logged in, you will see a table for either the linking table or the survey table. The "Linking Table" will display results of the social media platform along with the organization affiliation.
The "Survey Table" will display the survey results (including whether it was Provo or Plainsville).

When you click on the "More" tab you will be redirected to the home page where you will find a couple alternatives to social media, along with links to help you learn more about each.
